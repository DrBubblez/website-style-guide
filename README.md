## Description

This is an example style guide for a website. It is a simple, clean, and easy-to-read guide that can be used to help maintain consistency in the design of a website. It includes sections for Colors, Fonts, and Text Styles with examples of each. This style guide is made as a reference for myself in the future for any website projects I may work on.

## Usage

Simply use as a reference for your website projects. You can copy the code and modify it to fit your needs. The style guide is written in HTML and CSS. The colors are defined in CSS variables, so you can easily change the colors to fit your design. The fonts are imported from Google Fonts, so you can change the fonts to any Google Font you like.
